## Description:
In this project, we are tasked with analyzing and visualizing data from multiple AdventureWorks tables in order to provide insightful business metrics. The objective is to populate the **Overview** sheet with key analytical insights for business decision-making.

We will use the following tables:

1. **AdventureWorks.salesorderheader** (with salesreasonID)
2. **AdventureWorks.salesreason**
3. **AdventureWorks.employee** (with contact data)
4. **AdventureWorks.SalesTerritory**

Some redundant columns have been removed to improve performance. However, there may still be redundant columns, and itâ€™s important to choose what to use and what not to.

### Key Analytical Insights:

1. **Monthly Sales Trend**:  
   Business wants to observe how sales perform on a monthly basis.

2. **Online vs Non-Online Orders**:  
   Evaluation of online orders versus non-online orders is essential.

3. **Delivery Performance Trend**:  
   We will analyze the order date vs. ship date lag to identify delivery performance over time.

4. **Top Salesperson**:  
   Business would like to see the top salesperson by sales and by volume.

5. **Top Countries**:  
   Identifying top-performing countries in terms of sales.

6. **Top Sales Reasons**:  
   Understanding what drives sales based on the reasons provided.

7. **Additional Insights**:  
   Based on the available data, we may also uncover additional interesting patterns that can benefit the business.
